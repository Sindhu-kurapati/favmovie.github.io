    <h2><strong>*Synopsis</strong></h2>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The film opens by showing a large crowd waiting for <em>Rahul Jaykar</em>, a successful singer and musician whose career is waning because of his alcohol addiction-to perform at a stage show in Goa. 
        After nearly completing a song, he is unexpectedly interrupted by an artist, <em>Aryan</em>, who was losing his career due to <em>Rahul's</em>, during his performance. 
        <em>Rahul</em> fights him, stops his performance, and drives to a local bar.  He meets <em>Aarohi Keshav Shirke</em>, a bar singer who idolises <em>Rahul</em>. After noticing <em>Aarohi</em> looking at a photograph of <em>Lata Mangeshkar</em> in the bar, he assumes that she wants to become a singer. 
        Impressed by her simplicity and voice, Rahul promises to transform her into a singing sensation and asks her to never perform again in bars. Due to his assurance, Aarohi leaves her job and returns to Mumbai with Rahul, who convinces record producer Saigal to meet her. When Aarohi calls Rahul, he is attacked and injured by some thugs, and is unable to receive her call. His friend and manager Vivek decides that news of the assault on Rahul should not be leaked to the media, and instead publicises a false story that Rahul has left the country to participate in stage shows. When Aarohi attempts to contact Rahul again, Vivek ignores the calls. After two months of futilely attempting to contact Rahul, a broken Aarohi is forced to sing in bars again because of her family problems.
        Meanwhile, <em>Rahul</em> recovers from his injuries and again starts the search for <em>Aarohi</em>.
        He learns that <em>Aarohi</em> is working in a bar again and that <em>Vivek</em> had ignored her calls without informing him. 
        <em>Rahul</em> apologizes to <em>Aarohi</em> and fires <em>Vivek</em>, and they meet with Saigal for the recording agreement.
        <em>Rahul</em> begins to train <em>Aarohi</em>, who signs a music contract to sing in films and becomes a successful playback singer. 
        Her family and <em>Rahul</em> are happy, but when people begin to gossip that <em>Rahul</em> is using her as a servant, he relapses into alcohol addiction. 
        <em>Aarohi</em>, who loves <em>Rahul</em> more than her career, comforts him and they end up making love. 
        Despite <em>Aaohi's</em> mother <em>Subhasra's</em> disapproval, <em>Aarohi</em> moves in with <em>Rahul</em> and things go well until 
        <em>Rahul's</em> addiction worsens, causing him to become aggressive and violent.<em></em>
